    <!-- Content for Mission Statement page -->
    <p>This website is built upon a fairly inline-based code structure, to improve streaming performance, reduce file size, and make less calls to the server, which is lowering</p>
<p>carbon emissions in the process.</p>
<p>I am also running this website on a more eco-friendly hosting provider, which utilises virtual servers to cut down on electrical energy, as well as</p>
<p>being an inland company, based in the UK to reduce the use of outsourced materials and trade.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I accept donations to keep this website alive, however I do not accept crypto. This is due to crypto being a heavily energy-waste-heavy format</p>
<p>of financial gain; due to mining server farms.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I have used no imagery as to reduce data traffic going inbound/outbound of the server. I'm utilising proper caching where appropriate via my host's panel</p>
<p>and utilising features to stop bot-crawlers on the website; in the name of affordable energy.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This website was also built with help and hints from people of different genders, ethnicities, sexualities, and cultures. I aim to support the gender-equality acts</p>
<p>wherever possible, as well as adhering to the global sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Wherever possible, this website aims to inform, teach, and educate people on musical practices, cultures, freedoms of expression, and the allowance of better performance as a creative.</p>
<p>Pages will include works from people of all races, genders, ages, cultures, ethnicities etc wherever appropriate.</p>
