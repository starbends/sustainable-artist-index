    <!-- Content for Mission Statement page -->
    <p>This website is aimed to spotlight and champion smaller-level LGBT artists that are musicking in the current music scene.</p>
    <p>I believe that artists that are either LGBT or Pro-LGBT are not given the correct opportunities or fair chance in the music industry to grow effectively.</p>
    
    <p>This website aims to properly give them this chance.</p>
    <p>As artists, we are often bound by the shackles of the culture surrounding us - from genre, field, and those that shape contemporary music society.</p>
    <p>By removing these shackles, you find a wave of artists who are consistently endeveaoured to create better sonic experiences than those before them.</p>
    <p>With a condense and finite-sized simple indexed resource, we are able to fairly spotlight artists who are deserving of a chance. This will allow us to create a future where representation is a higher matter.</p>
