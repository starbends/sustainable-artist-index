    <p>This is a web project aimed at creating an accurate database of Pro-LGBT artists.</p>
    <p>It is done by hand, and it is done entirely manually, from sourcing to inputting. Please forgive me if there's mistakes, I do my best.</p>
    <p>If you notice any mistakes, do use the contact form to inform me if a link doesn't work, or if there's news of an artist listed making anti-LGBT statements.</p>
    <p>This website is intended as a university submission project, however may be continued in the future if it has any appreciated value by others.</p>
